Answers 12.   Processes in XV6 can be in one of three states: RUNNABLE, SLEEPING, ZOMBIE, UNUSED ,EMBRYO , RUNNING.
    UNUSED: Not currently in use; typically a newly created or terminated process.

    EMBRYO: In the process of being created but not yet ready to run.

    RUNNABLE: Ready to run but waiting for CPU allocation.

    RUNNING: Currently being executed by the CPU.

    SLEEPING: Not executing, waiting for a specific event (e.g., I/O completion).

    ZOMBIE: Terminated process with an exit status still needed by its parent process.

    
Answers 13.    The XV6 file system is a simple file system with key components like inodes, directories, and blocks.

    Inodes: Store metadata about files.
    Directories: Organize files hierarchically.
    Blocks: Store file data.

    
Answers 14.     System calls are interfaces to the operating system, whereas library functions are pre-compiled routines provided by libraries.

    Example of a system call: fork() for process creation.
    Example of a library function: printf() for formatted output.

    
Answers 15.   Memory paging in XV6 involves dividing physical memory into fixed-size pages. It provides benefits such as efficient use of memory and isolation of processes.


Answers 16.    Three essential shell commands in XV6:

    ls: List directory contents.
    cd: Change current directory.
    cp: Copy files or directories.

    
Answers 17. Process synchronization is crucial to coordinate the activities of multiple processes. Mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and conditional variables are used to achieve synchronization in XV6.

Answers 18. Interrupts in XV6 are crucial for handling asynchronous events. They are handled by specific interrupt service routines (ISRs) and are vital for I/O handling and timekeeping.

Answers 19. Virtual memory in XV6 provides processes with the illusion of a larger address space than physically available. It is implemented through paging, offering benefits such as memory isolation and easy process creation.

Answers 20.     The boot process involves:

    Power-on: The computer is powered on.
    BIOS/UEFI: Basic system initialization.
    Bootloader: Loads the XV6 kernel into memory.
    Kernel Initialization: Sets up essential data structures.
    Executing Init Process: Initiates user space processes.
